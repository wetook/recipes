tools:
- KitchenAid stand mixer

ingredients:
  Dough:
  - 3/4 cup warm milk
  - 1/4 cup water
  - 1 egg
  - 2 tablespoons butter
  - 3 tablespoons sugar
  - 1 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 3 1/4 cups bread flour (if you must substitute all-purpose flour, you will need a little more)
  - 3 teaspoons instant or bread machine yeast
  Toppings:
  - 1 egg + 1 teaspoon water
  - sesame seeds or poppy seeds
  - dried garlic and onion

steps:
- Place ingredients in order listed into your mixer (milk to yeast). Stir until doughy. Swap the stir thing for the dough hook and knead on speed 2. Slowly add more water or flour if the consistency is no good.
- When the dough has risen into a smooth, elastic ball (about 5-10 minutes), remove dough to floured board or silicone sheet.
- Divide dough into two parts then each of those halves into 4 pieces making a total of 8.
- Loosely form each piece into a fat, rope shape. Then, STEP AWAY! Let the dough relax for about 10 minutes and life will be easier. Well... maybe not, but your dough will be much more agreeable about shaping.
- Using your hands, roll and pull each rope into an elongated piece of dough approximately 12 inches long. It doesn't have to be perfect. Then starting at one end, roll up like a snail.
- Place about 2 inches apart in a large pan or on a greased cookie sheet. Even better if covered with parchment paper or a silicone sheet. Tuck the end of the coil underneath the roll as you place it in the pan. With the palm of your hand, flatten coil slightly. Cover with a towel.
- Let rise in a warm place till double. Preheat oven to 400 degrees convection bake. Flatten rolls with the palm of your hand again down to about 1-inch thickness. Don't worry, they will pop up in the oven. Brush each roll with egg wash. Sprinkle buns seeds or dried garlic/onion.
- Bake in preheated oven for 10-12 minutes until golden. Cool on wire rack. When cool, split with a serrated knife to make sandwich buns.
