- 2 tsp baking powder

- 3/4 cup (180g) ricotta (low-fat or whole)

steps:

- In a mixing bowl whisk together flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt for 20 seconds.
- Make a well in center of flour mixture and set aside.
- In a separate large mixing bowl, whisk together milk, ricotta, eggs and vanilla until well blended.
- Add butter, lemon zest and lemon juice to milk mixture and blend until combined (it will curdle a little, that's fine).
- Immediately pour milk mixture into flour mixture and whisk just to combined (batter should be slightly lumpy).
