ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups (214g) all-purpose flour (scoop and level to measure)
- 3 1/2 Tbsp (46g) granulated sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup (236ml) milk
- 3/4 cup (180g) ricotta (low-fat or whole)

- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 - 2 Tbsp lemon zest (depending on how lemony you want them)
- 1/4 cup (60ml) fresh lemon juice
- 1 Tbsp (14g) butter, melted

steps:
- Preheat an electric griddle to moderately-high heat (or us a non-stick skillet set over medium heat).
- In a mixing bowl whisk together flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt for 20 seconds.
- Make a well in center of flour mixture and set aside.
- In a separate large mixing bowl, whisk together milk, ricotta, eggs and vanilla until well blended.
- Add butter, lemon zest and lemon juice to milk mixture and blend until combined (it will curdle a little, that's fine).
- Immediately pour milk mixture into flour mixture and whisk just to combined (batter should be slightly lumpy).
- Pour 1/3 cup batter onto buttered griddle or skillet and cook until bubbles begin to appear on surface and bottom is golden brown, then flip and cook opposite side until golden brown.
