ingredients:
- Gruyere
- Cheddar
- Havarti
- Red potatoes - enough
- Red onion - one large
- Butter - ~0.75 sticks
- Whole milk - ~1 cup
- Flour - same as butter
- Salt - a bunch
- Pepper - a bunch
- wine (oaked california chardonnay or best substitute) - ~0.7 cups

tools
- mandolin
- rectangular glass or metal pan

steps:
- Mandolin up the potatoes into half-thumb thick pieces. Mandolin the onion into thinner than that pieces.
- Preheat an oven to 425.
- Make a roux - melt better over medium heat, add equal parts flour, mix vigorously. Add 2-4x as much milk while continuing to stir. Add cheddar and gruyere and wine. Keep stirring forever. Add salt and pepper when its fully melted. Don’t stop the stirring.
- Layer all the food in a big old pan. Glass is preferred, metal is probably ok but looks worse. One layer potato, then some onion, then some ripped up slices of havarti. Pour a bit of the sauce on, spreading evenly and thinly. Repeat with another layer. For the third and final layer, skip the onions and just do potatoes, havarti, and sauce.
- Throw the pan(s) in the oven for something like 90 minutes. It’ll be crispy brown when done. Serve with meat.
