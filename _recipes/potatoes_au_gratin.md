title: Potatoes au Gratin
tags:
- side
- vegetarian
- cheesy
- misc

ingredients:
- Gruyere
- Cheddar
- Havarti
- Red potatoes - enough
- Red onion - one large
- Butter - ~0.75 sticks
- Whole milk - ~1 cup
- Flour - a bit
- Salt - a bunch
- Pepper - a bunch

tools:
- mandolin
- rectangular glass or metal pan

steps:
- Mandolin up the potatoes into half-thumb thick pieces. Mandolin the onion into thinner than that pieces.
- Throw the butter, cheddar, and gruyere into a sauce pot on medium-low heat. Add milk once it starts to melt. Keep stirring forever. Add salt and pepper when its fully melted. Don’t stop the stirring. Add a bit of flour for some thickening.
- Preheat an oven to 425.
- Layer all the food in a big old pan. Glass is preferred, metal is probably ok but looks worse. One layer potato, then some onion, then some ripped up slices of havarti. Pour a bit of the cheese sauce on. It will be lumpy and people will tell you its wrong - ignore them, they’re jealous. Repeat with another layer. For the third and final layer, skip the onions and just do potatoes, havarti, and sauce.
- Throw the pan(s) in the oven for something like 90 minutes. It’ll be crispy brown when done. Serve with meat.
