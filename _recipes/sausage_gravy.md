title: Sausage Gravy
tags:
- sausage
- breakfast
- misc

ingredients:
- 1 tube of Jimmy Dean sausage
- a cup or three of whole milk or half and half or that really fatty ice cream milk
- 50ml Lousiana style hot sauce, preferably Hank's Heat Hot Sauce
- lots of black pepper, salt, cayenne, paprika
- bit of oil
- 1 - 2 tbsp of flour

steps:
- Heat up a medium sized pot on medium-high heat. Add a splash of oil and get that real hot too.
- Squeeze the meattube into the pot. With a spatula or wooden spoon, break up the meat and stir it while it cooks.
- When the sausage is almost fully cooked (should still be a bit pink), add salt and a lot of pepper. More pepper than that. Keep going. Ok.
- Pour dairy to about 1cm higher than the sausage. Reduce heat and stir. You're aiming for a rolling simmer, almost like the cream is separating on top. Let it ride for like 4 minutes.
- Add paprika, cayenne, more pepper (yes it needs it), and about 40-60ml of hot sauce. Stir it in. Reduce heat more and stir in a bit of flour. Keep stirring occasionally.
- When ready to serve, turn heat completely off and let the gravy sit for 3-5 minutes to thicken and cool. Ladle over [biscuits](biscuits) and slap an egg on it.
