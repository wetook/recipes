ingredients:
- 2 cups cream
- 1 cup whole milk
- 8 egg yolks
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 tablespoons alcohol
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste

tools:
- Ice cream maker

steps:
- In a heavy saucepan, bring cream and milk to a bare simmer.
- Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a bowl until well-combined and light in color. Slowly pour yolk mixture into dairy mixture, whisking well to combine. Cook custard on low heat, whisking frequently, until it thickens, coating the back of a spoon but leaving a clean line when swiped with a finger.
