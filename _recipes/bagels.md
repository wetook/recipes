tools:
- KitchenAid stand mixer

ingredients:
- 19.25 ounces bread flour (3 1/2 cups) [530g]
- 1/4 ounce instant dry yeast (2 1/2 teaspoons; or 1 envelope active dry) [7g]
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 12 ounces hot water (1 1/2 cups, 120°–130°F) [340g]
- 1 tbsp molasses (for the boiling water; alternatively, you can use 1 tbsp sugar)
- 1 egg beaten with 1 teaspoon water (for toppings)

steps:
- Add all the dry ingredients to the bowl of a stand mixer and stir together. With the mixer running, slowly add the water; knead with the dough hook on speed 2 until dough comes together into a satiny ball.
- Cover mixer bowl with plastic wrap and let sit until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
- "After dough has risen but before you divide and shape it, prepare your water bath: Add the molasses to 4 quarts of water over high heat and let it come to a boil as you continue with the following steps."
- Preheat oven to 425 convection bake.
- After dough has doubled in bulk, turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface and press down with your fingers to expel the gases. Divide dough into equal portions - 10 makes the most traditional size, but 8 is way easier to do.
- Ball a portion of dough, then roll it into a "rope" about 7 inches long and about 1 inch thick. Taper the ends a bit.
- Wrap the dough around your hand, overlapping the ends in your palm. Place your hand, along with the dough, palm-down on the work surface and roll dough back and forth until ends crimp and seal together. If you wear Men's Large or bigger gloves, only wrap the dough around three fingers. Same if you prefer a small hole in the middle.
- "At this point, your malt syrup–water should be boiling. Use a skimmer or slotted spoon to carefully add bagels, one at a time, to the water. (Note: no more in the pot than 3 at a time .) Bagels should sink but then rise again after a few seconds. Simmer for 1 minute, flipping bagels at the 30-second mark."
- Remove bagels from water with skimmer or slotted spoon to a drying rack.
- "<p>For eating in the next 0-3 days: put in tupperware or plastic wrap in fridge. When ready to consume, follow directions like normal. Make sure to allow the bagels to warm up a bit.</p><p>After 4-5 days the they collapse a bit and the appearance goes to the pooper but they're still good, and with more than 5 days they're no better than a blueberry-oat day-old bread-sliced monstrosity from Panera.</p>"
- "For bagel toppings: Brush bagel with egg-water mixture. Place bagels on wire cooling rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. Shake on desired toppings. Sesame seed, poppy seed, kosher salt, minced onion, minced garlic, and caraway seeds are correct. The baking sheet will collect excess dry toppings (such as sesame or poppy seeds). Simply pour them back into their containers for reuse."
- Place bagels on baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Bake until light brown and shiny, 15 to 20 minutes. Flip, and bake until reverse side is crisp and brown, about 10 minutes more.
- Allow to cool before cutting. Immediately slicing open can sometimes leave the inside too doughy and it's also hot af.
