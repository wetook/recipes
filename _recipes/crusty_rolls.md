tools:
- KitchenAid stand mixer

ingredients:
  Dough:
  - 1 cup hot water
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 1.5 teaspoon salt
  - 1.5 teaspoon sugar
  - 1.5 cup all-purpose unbleached flour
  - 1.5 cup bread flour
  - 1 teaspoon bread machine or instant yeast
  Glaze:
  - 1/4 cup water + 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch mixed in 2 cup pyrex container and heated in a microwave for 20 seconds on HIGH or until thick.
steps:
- Add water, olive oil, salt, sugar, flour, and yeast to the mixer. Stir it all up real good.
- Set mixer to speed 2 with the dough hook and kneed for 2-3 minutes. At this point the dough should be sticking to the side and pulling away fairly cleanly. Add flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if the dough is too sticky, or add water 1 tablespoon at a time if dough is too dry (dough slaps against the side).
- When the dough has risen into a smooth, elastic ball (about 5-10 more minutes), remove dough to floured board or silicone sheet.
- For dinner rolls divide dough in half (2 pieces), then cut each half in half (4 pieces) and finally, divide each of those pieces in half again resulting in 8 rolls. Form into balls.
- Cover a cookie baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper. Lightly scatter cornmeal over the sheet before placing the round dough balls onto the cookie sheet--evenly spaced from each other.
- Cover dough balls with a tea towel and set in a warm place for about 45 minutes or until risen almost double.
- Brush rolls with cooled cornstarch glaze. Use a serrated knife to make a small gash in the top, if desired, but it's not required.
- Bake in 375 degree pre-heated oven for 35 minutes until crust is crisp and brown.

This recipe is copied almost verbatum, but I'm pretty sure I used a buttload more water last time I made these.
