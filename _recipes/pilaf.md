ingredients:
- 1 cup rice
- 1/2 onion or shallot
- 1-2 cloves garlic
- 1/4 cup orzo
- 1cup+ chicken broth/stock
- lemon juice
- dried dill
- salt

steps:
- Measure rice according to directions into a bowl. Cover with cold water and let soak for 20 minutes. Drain with a colander.
- Chop up some onion and garlic.
- In a medium pot, heat some oil on medium-high heat. Cook the onion in the oil. Add garlic and orzo and mix it all around to coat the orzo.
- Reduce heat to a low simmer. Add lots of chicken juice. The solids should be fully covered in liquid. Add lemon juice, salt, pepper, and oregano. Stir it all up and cover the pot. Let simmer until the liquid is all absorbed (~20 minutes), stirring occassionally. If the liquid is gone before the rice is soft, add more.
- Remove from heat and mix in dill.
