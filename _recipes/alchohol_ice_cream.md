- vegetarian

ingredients:
- 2 cups cream
- 1 cup whole milk
- 8 egg yolks
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 tablespoons alcohol
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste

tools:
- Ice cream maker

steps:
- In a heavy saucepan, bring cream and milk to a bare simmer.
- Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a bowl until well-combined and light in color. Slowly pour yolk mixture into dairy mixture, whisking well to combine. Cook custard on low heat, whisking frequently, until it thickens, coating the back of a spoon but leaving a clean line when swiped with a finger.
- Strain into an airtight container, then stir in vanilla extract and alcohol. Add salt to taste. Chill overnight, then churn the next day according to manufacturer's instructions. Eat immediately as soft-serve or let firm up in freezer for two to three hours.
